# flutter_blue_app

started a chat app with the arduino or raspberry pi via Bluetooth
evolved to have a graph for displaying active moisture data on request
from a bluetooth connected raspberry pi 
Primary modifications are in the AppPage.dart and MainPage.dart, all other
modifications were for compatibility issues, please reference the original app
for concerns on other components (https://github.com/rickyhh2/flutter_rpi_bluetooth_client)
